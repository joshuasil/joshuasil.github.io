I build HIPAA-compliant health technology systems—and the infrastructure to run them securely at scale.

My expertise spans **health informatics research**, **enterprise cloud architecture**, **machine learning engineering**, **compliance systems design**, **startup technology leadership**, and **production-scale healthcare software development**. I've published peer-reviewed research, architected multi-account AWS environments with Control Tower, built ML pipelines for clinical applications, and co-founded a healthcare tech company that emerged from university research.

### Currently

**IT Program Manager** at the **Colorado School of Public Health**, architecting and leading development of enterprise health informatics platforms that serve clinical research, public health interventions, and data analytics at scale.

**Co-founder & CTO** at **ClinicChat**—a health technology startup that evolved from my university research into a SaaS platform. With support from CU Innovations and the tech transfer office, we're building multi-tenant healthcare infrastructure that combines conversational AI, clinical workflows, IoT integrations, and real-time analytics to serve healthcare organizations nationwide.

### What Drives Me

Healthcare technology sits at the intersection of rigorous engineering, clinical research, regulatory complexity, and real human impact. I'm drawn to problems that require both deep technical expertise and systems thinking—building platforms that advance health outcomes through innovative software while meeting the highest standards for security, compliance, and clinical evidence. Whether it's publishing peer-reviewed research on AI-powered health interventions or scaling infrastructure to serve healthcare organizations nationwide, I focus on creating technology that meaningfully improves how healthcare is delivered.

### Background

M.S. in Information Systems (Business Analytics) from **CU Denver** • B.E. in Mechanical Engineering from **Anna University**
